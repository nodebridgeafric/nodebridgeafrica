It looks like your system may have SSH installed under a different service name or it might not be installed at all. Here’s how to troubleshoot:

1.  **Check for OpenSSH Installation:** First, check if OpenSSH is installed:

    ```bash
    dpkg -l | grep openssh
    ```

    If it’s not installed, you can install it using:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openssh-server
    ```
2.  **Check the Correct Service Name:** On some systems, the SSH service is named `ssh` instead of `ssh.service`. You can check the status with:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status sshd
    ```

    If you find `sshd`, you can manage it using:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start sshd
    sudo systemctl enable sshd
    ```
3.  **Start the SSH Service:** If SSH is installed and the service is running, start it with the correct name:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start ssh
    ```
4.  **Verify Configuration:** After starting the service, check the status again:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status ssh
    ```
5.  **Check Firewall Again:** If SSH is running, ensure the firewall allows it:

    ```bash
    sudo ufw allow ssh
    ```

After following these steps, you should be able to enable and start SSH on your node. Let me know if you run into any issues!
