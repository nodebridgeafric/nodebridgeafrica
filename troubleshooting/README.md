Using FileZilla to transfer files is straightforward. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

#### 1. Download and Install FileZilla

#### 2. Open FileZilla

#### 3. Connect to the Server

* **Host**: Enter the FTP server address (e.g., `ftp.example.com`).
* **Username**: Enter your FTP username.
* **Password**: Enter your FTP password.
* **Port**: Usually, this is 21 for FTP. For SFTP, it’s typically 22.
* Click **Quickconnect**.

#### 4. Navigate to Local and Remote Directories

* The left panel shows your local files (your computer).
* The right panel shows the remote files (server).
* Navigate through folders in both panels to locate the files you want to transfer.

#### 5. Transfer Files

* To upload a file: Drag and drop it from the left panel (local) to the right panel (remote).
* To download a file: Drag and drop it from the right panel (remote) to the left panel (local).

#### 6. Monitor the Transfer
