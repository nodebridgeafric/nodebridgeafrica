# permission to write to the local directory

The `scp` command is failing because you don't have permission to write to the local directory `/home/david/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys/`. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1.  **Check Local Directory Permissions:** Run the following command to check the permissions of the `validator_keys` directory:

    ```bash
    ls -ld /home/david/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys/
    ```

    Ensure that you have write permissions for this directory.
2.  **Change Directory Permissions:** If you don't have write permissions, you can change them (if you have the necessary rights):

    ```bash
    chmod u+w /home/david/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys/
    ```

    Alternatively, if you need to change ownership, use:

    ```bash
    sudo chown -R david:david /home/david/staking-deposit-cli/validator_keys/
    ```
3.  **Use a Different Local Directory:** If modifying permissions isn't an option, you can download the files to a different directory where you have write permissions. For example:

    ```bash
    scp -P 22 -r david@104.154.35.215:/home/david/staking-deposit-cli ~/downloaded_staking_deposit/
    ```
4. **Run `scp` with `sudo`:** If you really need to write to that directory and have sudo privileges, you can run the `scp` command with `sudo`, but this can be tricky because `scp` typically doesn't handle `sudo` well. Instead, you might copy files to a temp location and then move them with `sudo`.
5.  **Check Disk Space:** Ensure that you have enough disk space in your local directory:

    ```bash
    df -h
    ```

After making the necessary changes, try running the `scp` command again. Let me know if you need further assistance!
