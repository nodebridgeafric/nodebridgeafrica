# 1. Buying/exchanging or consolidating ETH

{% hint style="info" %}
Every 32 ETH you own allows you to make 1 validator. You can run thousands of validators with your beacon node.
{% endhint %}

Your ETH (or multiples of 32 ETH) should be consolidated into a single address accessible with Metamask.
