### **What is an Ethereum Node?**

An **Ethereum node** is a computer system that participates in the Ethereum blockchain network by maintaining a copy of the blockchain, verifying transactions, and contributing to the consensus mechanism. Ethereum nodes are key to the decentralization of the network, ensuring that no single entity controls the system, thus enhancing security and resilience.

### **Importance of Nodes in Africa**

The role of Ethereum nodes is particularly significant in Africa, where decentralized technologies are gaining momentum due to their ability to foster financial inclusion, enhance transparency, and catalyze innovation. Africa is witnessing rapid growth in blockchain adoption, with use cases spanning across financial services, identity verification, and supply chain management. Countries like [Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya](https://investafrica360.org/the-impact-of-blockchain-adoption-in-africa/) are emerging as leading hubs for blockchain and cryptocurrency, offering alternative solutions to traditional banking systems that are often inaccessible to large segments of the population. In fact, Africa is one of the fastest-growing regions for blockchain development, showing a [429% increase in blockchain funding in 2022​.](https://www.cvvc.com/press-releases/cv-vcs-second-annual-african-blockchain-report-affirms-the-impact-of-blockchain-in-africa) As a result, running an Ethereum node in Africa to support the decentralization, security, and scalability of the network is more important than ever. The following sections provide an overview of the setup requirements for running an Ethereum node in Africa.
