# Internet Requirement

## Internet

* Ideally your internet connection should be reliable and as close to 24/7 as possible without interruption.
* Ensure your bandwidth can't be throttled and isn't capped so your node stays in sync and will be ready to validate when called.
* You need enough upload bandwidth too. As of May 2022 this is \~1.2-1.3 GB download and \~0.9-1 GB upload per hour, and is likely to increase.

Note:

* Avoid overly-complicated setups and be aware of trade offs. Being offline for brief periods of time will result in small inactivity penalities, but will be recouped easily after being online again for about the same amount of time. Complicated power backups can add to the expense of your setup, and redundant backup validators can lead to a more serious penalty known as slashing.

* Syncing your execution client may take a few days in the worst-case scenario
