# Hardware Requirements

## Hard Drive

* You need to run an [execution client](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#execution-client) as well as your [consensus client](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#consensus-client).
* Since the Merge, third-party providers (such as Infura and Alchemy) are no longer viable options to outsource execution layer responsibilities. All stakers must run both an execution and a consensus client to properly attest to the network.
* As of May 2022, you'll need \~1TB for the Mainnet execution chain data alone (growing at >1GB/day).
* Ethereum had its genesis on July 30, 2015. It is growing in size over time, and the introduction of Danksharding will also increase storage, memory, and bandwidth requirements.
* You'll need SSD storage to consistently handle necessary read/write speeds.
* Be sure to account for enough space on your drive until you run maintenance on your node.

**Recommendation disclaimer**

Hardware suggestions are an ever-evolving target. Current minimum requirements are likely to increase by an order of magnitude after the introduction of Danksharding. Do your own research before depositing funds.

## CPU and RAM

* Check with client documentation to ensure the hardware you want to use is sufficient and supported.
* Resource usage can vary significantly between clients. Research the different clients if you're working with resource constraints.
